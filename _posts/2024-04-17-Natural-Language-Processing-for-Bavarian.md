We are proud to present our recent research on NLP for Bavarian / **NLP fi Bairisch**! 

Dialects were a blind spot for NLP research, as it has focused largely on the 'standard' language variant(s). We aim to contribute to closing this gap in this project.

- Siyao Peng, Zihang Sun, Huangyan Shan, Marie Kolm, Verena Blaschke, Ekaterina Artemova and Barbara Plank. *Sebastian, Basti, Wastl?! Recognizing Named Entities in Bavarian Dialectal Data.* In LREC-COLING 2024.
