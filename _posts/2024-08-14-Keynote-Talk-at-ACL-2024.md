At <a href="https://2024.aclweb.org/program/keynotes/#barbara-plank">ACL 2024</a> Prof. Barbara Blank held a keynote presentation on the topic "Are LLMs Narrowing Our Horizon? Let’s Embrace Variation in NLP!"

While acknowledging the remarkable achievements in NLP and their increasing integration into society, Barbara highlighted concerns about the field becoming more homogeneous. She presented a compelling case for embracing variation across three essential dimensions: model inputs, outputs, and research approaches. This strategy, she argued, is key to developing more trustworthy and innovative human-facing NLP systems.
