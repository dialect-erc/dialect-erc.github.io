### Adding Publications
Copy the Bibtex reference of the publication and add the reference to _bibliography/papers.bib. Make sure that the following fields in the Bibtex reference are populated, as these will be used to create the publication's entry on the website:
 - year
 - month
 - author
 - url
 - booktitle (or journal)

### Known Issues
 - Breadcrumbs only work for home. Deeper layers add a trailing / which does not seem to work on the live server
 - Add pagination for news and publications
