    abstract = "Bilingual word lexicons map words in one language to their synonyms in another language. Numerous papers have explored bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) in high-resource scenarios, framing a typical pipeline that consists of two steps: (i) unsupervised bitext mining and (ii) unsupervised word alignment. At the core of those steps are pre-trained large language models (LLMs).In this paper we present the analysis of the BLI pipeline for German and two of its dialects, Bavarian and Alemannic. This setup poses a number of unique challenges, attributed to the scarceness of resources, relatedness of the languages and lack of standardization in the orthography of dialects. We analyze the BLI outputs with respect to word frequency and the pairwise edit distance. Finally, we release an evaluation dataset consisting of manual annotations for 1K bilingual word pairs labeled according to their semantic similarity.",

    abstract = "Despite much progress in recent years, the vast majority of work in natural language processing (NLP) is on standard languages with many speakers. In this work, we instead focus on low-resource languages and in particular non-standardized low-resource languages. Even within branches of major language families, often considered well-researched, little is known about the extent and type of available resources and what the major NLP challenges are for these language varieties. The first step to address this situation is a systematic survey of available corpora (most importantly, annotated corpora, which are particularly valuable for NLP research). Focusing on Germanic low-resource language varieties, we provide such a survey in this paper. Except for geolocation (origin of speaker or document), we find that manually annotated linguistic resources are sparse and, if they exist, mostly cover morphosyntax. Despite this lack of resources, we observe that interest in this area is increasing: there is active development and a growing research community. To facilitate research, we make our overview of over 80 corpora publicly available.",

There is a wide variety of tools available; setting up these tools is however a hindrance. We propose Eevee, an annotation tool focused on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. It can run directly in the browser (no setup required) and uses tab-separated files (as opposed to character offsets or task-specific formats) for annotation. It allows for annotation of multiple tasks on a single dataset and supports four task-types: sequence labeling, span labeling, text classification and seq2seq.",
